🩺 Skin Cancer Detection System

A Machine Learning–based web application designed to detect potential skin cancer from dermatoscopic images using the HAM10000 dataset.
The project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can assist early skin lesion analysis and support healthcare diagnostics.

📌 Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection significantly increases treatment success rates.
This project applies machine learning and image classification techniques to analyze skin lesion images and predict possible cancer types.

The system integrates a trained ML model with a web application backend to provide predictions based on uploaded images.

🎯 Objectives
Build an AI model for skin lesion classification
Apply image preprocessing and feature extraction
Integrate ML model with a backend API
Demonstrate real-world healthcare AI application
📂 Dataset

This project uses the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset Source:
HAM10000 – Human Against Machine Dataset (Kaggle)

Dataset Details
10,000+ dermatoscopic skin lesion images
Multiple diagnostic categories including:
Melanoma
Melanocytic nevi
Basal cell carcinoma
